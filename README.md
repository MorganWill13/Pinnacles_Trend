# Pinnacles_Trend

Project Objectives:
1. Model abundance of 3 target species of deep-sea corals in the Pinnacles Trend Mesophotic Area
2. Identify best sample sites for collecting target species (based on abundance and accessibility)
3. Identify model validation sample sites

Structure of Code Base:
- Project working directory: 
- Main project folder broken into 3 folders: Data, Scripts, and Outputs
   - Data folder: Contains raw data to be used (if data files were too large for upload, links to raw data and instructions on how they were filtered are included in the markdown files)
   - Scripts folder ():
     - DSCRTP_Filtering.Rmd: Filtering large data set downloaded from DSCRTP data portal to location, depth range, and species of interest
     - DSCRTP_Pinnacles.Rmd: analysis of DSCRPT data within the mesophotic area of the Pinnacles Trend region (small area in the Gulf of Mexico), focused on three species of interest
   - Outputs folder ():
      - Figures folder (): Final figures to be used in report
      - Final_Data folder (): Finalized data files for use in further analysis
